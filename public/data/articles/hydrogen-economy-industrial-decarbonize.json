For decades, these industries were the primary stumbling blocks in the path to Net Zero, as battery technology lacks the energy density required for high-heat industrial processes. But in 2026, 'Green Hydrogen'—produced via electrolysis using 100% renewable power—is moving from the pilot phase to the backbone of the industrial grid.",

By late 2026, the first '100% Green Steel' will be delivered to automotive manufacturers, marking the beginning of a supply chain that is carbon-neutral from the raw ore to the final vehicle chassis."

            "text": "To support this demand, the production of PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) electrolyzers has undergone a scaling process similar to the solar panel boom of the 2010s. Gigafactories in Norway and China are now producing electrolyzer stacks with a combined capacity of 20GW per year. This massive increase in volume, combined with the plummeting cost of offshore wind power, has brought the price of green hydrogen below the 'tipping point' of $2 per kilogram—making it competitive with coal-based alternatives for the first time."

By coating the interior of legacy steel pipes with specialized polymers to prevent hydrogen embrittlement, nations are creating a 'Hydrogen Backbone' without the need for trillions in new investment. This allows for the immediate distribution of green fuel from coastal wind farms to inland industrial hubs. As we look toward 2030, the 'Hydrogen Economy' is no longer a futuristic concept—it is the industrial reality that is keeping our heavy manufacturing alive in a climate-conscious world."
