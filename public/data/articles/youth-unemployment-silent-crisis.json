In many developed economies, real youth unemployment—including those who have stopped looking for work or are severely 'underemployed' in low-skill gig work—has hit its highest levels in a decade. This isn't just a temporary dip; it's a structural rupture in the career ladder.",

Today, those junior administrative and analytical tasks are being performed by large language models. This has removed the 'first rung' of the corporate ladder, leaving new graduates with no clear way to gain the '2-3 years of experience' that every job listing now demands."

Beyond the financial impact, there is a burgeoning mental health crisis. Young people, promised that education would guarantee stability, are finding themselves priced out of housing markets and stuck in a state of 'extended adolescence' through no fault of their own."

As traditional white-collar roles face the GPT-onslaught, demand for physical high-tech roles—electricians for EV infrastructure, solar grid technicians, and robotic maintenance engineers—is skyrocketing. Governments that pivot their education funding toward these 'un-automatable' skills are the ones that will avoid the social unrest of an idle youth population."

Without it, the talent that should be driving the next innovation wave will remain trapped in the waiting room of the global economy."
