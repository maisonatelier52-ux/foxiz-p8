The treaty, colloquially known as the Geneva Accord, establishes the first international legal framework for the military and civilian use of AI.",

These systems, often described as 'slaughterbots,' are drones or robotic platforms programmed to identify, track, and attack targets without a 'human-in-the-loop' to make the final decision to use force."

Major military powers argued that defensive automated systems—such as missile interceptors—should be exempt. The final compromise allows for automated defensive responses but mandates that any offensive operation must be traceable to a specific human commander who bears legal responsibility for the outcome."

It mandates 'algorithmic transparency' for any system used by governments to determine credit scores, employment eligibility, or criminal sentencing. Signatory nations must now establish independent 'AI Auditing Agencies' to ensure that software does not reinforce racial or gender biases."

Nevertheless, the Geneva Accord sets a new global norm that will likely determine the trajectory of artificial intelligence for the next fifty years."
