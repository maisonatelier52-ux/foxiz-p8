That joke died today at 10:14 AM GMT, when the Nova-1 facility successfully synchronized its output with the national electrical grid, delivering 150 megawatts of carbon-free energy to thousands of homes across Southern England.",

By utilizing high-temperature superconducting magnets, the team at Tokamak Energy managed to contain plasma at a staggering 100 million degrees Celsius—six times hotter than the core of the sun—within a footprint no larger than a standard warehouse."

The byproduct is harmless helium, and the fuel can be extracted from seawater. There is no risk of a 'meltdown,' as any disruption to the magnetic field causes the plasma to cool and the reaction to stop instantly."

The company has already signed preliminary agreements to build ten more 'Solaris-class' reactors in the United States and Singapore. The goal is to bring the cost of fusion energy below that of coal and natural gas by 2035."

As the first fusion-powered lights flickered on in Oxfordshire this morning, the world caught a glimpse of a future defined by limitless, clean energy."
