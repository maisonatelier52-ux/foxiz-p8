This morning, researchers at the NeuralLink Institute announced the success of 'Synapse-1,' a high-bandwidth encephalogram (EEG) array that requires no surgery but offers the control resolution of implanted electrodes. The first trial participant, a 34-year-old with complete spinal paralysis, was able to walk across the laboratory using a robotic exoskeleton controlled entirely by intention.",

            "text": "Unlike previous EEG caps that suffered from 'signal noise' caused by the skull, Synapse-1 uses a quantum magnetometer array that can detect the magnetic signatures of individual neuron clusters. This extreme sensitivity allows the software to distinguish between 'walking forward' and 'stopping' with a latency of less than 15 milliseconds—faster than the human central nervous system."

The interface includes an 'Auto-Feedback' loop that can enhance concentration by damping cognitive noise. Early adopters in the design and engineering fields have already expressed interest in using the interface to manipulate 3D models with their minds, potentially ending the era of the mouse and keyboard."

If a machine can read your motor intentions, can it eventually read your memories or emotions? Civil rights groups are calling for an immediate moratorium on the commercial release of the technology until 'Neural Sealing' protocols—encryption for the mind—are legally mandated and technically verified."
