Inside the scorched lithium-titanium shell lies a cargo worth an estimated $85 million—not in currency, but in the raw materials that will build the next generation of green technology.",

Using a swarm of secondary-ion micro-drills, Aurelius-7 was able to selectively extract high-value minerals from the surface of Psyche-16, an asteroid known to be the exposed metallic core of a failed protoplanet."

With terrestrial mining facing increasing environmental and political constraints, the success of Aurelius-7 proves that the 'infinite resources' of space are finally within reach."

However, the mission also raises complex legal questions. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits nations from claiming celestial bodies, but it is silent on the ownership of extracted resources—a loophole Orion Resources is eager to exploit."
