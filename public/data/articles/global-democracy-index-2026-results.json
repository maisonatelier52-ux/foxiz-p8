However, the broader data paints a grim picture of the global state of governance, with the overall index average falling for the third consecutive year.",

This decline is largely attributed to the paralysis of legislative bodies in the face of hyper-polarization and the increasing influence of algorithmic news feeds that prioritize outrage over nuance."

These states prioritize rapid economic development and social order over traditional liberal democratic norms. While their scores in civil liberties are low, their high scores in public safety and infrastructure delivery have led to a 'legitimacy of outcomes' that challenges the Western consensus."

This measures how well a nation protects its electoral processes from deepfake manipulation and foreign influence campaigns. Nations that have implemented 'Certified Information Streams'—like South Korea and Taiwan—saw their rankings rise, while those with unregulated digital spheres tumbled into the 'Flawed Democracy' category."
