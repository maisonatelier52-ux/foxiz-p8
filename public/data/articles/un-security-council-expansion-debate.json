At the 81st General Assembly this week, a coalition of 'G4' nations officially submitted a proposal to expand the Security Council's permanent membership, arguing that the current 'P5' arrangement fails to reflect the reality of the 21st-century power balance.",

Supporters argue that without these changes, the UN risks becoming obsolete as regional powers increasingly turn to alternative blocs like the BRICS+ and the E8 for security coordination."

While the P5 nations—the US, UK, France, Russia, and China—have expressed varying degrees of support for expansion in principle, they remain unified in their refusal to share the veto power. This 'two-tier' permanent status is being rejected by the African Union, which demands at least two permanent seats with full veto rights for the continent."

As the summit continues, the risk of a formal walkout by several key nations remains high. The outcome of these negotiations will determine whether the United Nations can survive as a truly universal arbiter of peace or if the world is headed toward a total fragmentation of international law."
