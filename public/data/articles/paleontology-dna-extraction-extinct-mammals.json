For years, scientists believed that the 'Half-Life' of genetic material meant that nothing older than a million years could ever be recovered. But this week, the 'Copenhagen Epoch' project announced that they have extracted and sequenced DNA from sediment samples dated to 2.4 million years ago. This isn't just DNA from a single bone; it is 'Environmental DNA' (eDNA)—the genetic residue of an entire lost world.",

But the DNA reveals a landscape that was once a lush boreal forest, populated by mastodons, reindeer, and an extinct species of giant beaver. The high concentration of clay in the sediment acted as a 'molecular time capsule,' binding the DNA fragments and protecting them from degradation for eons."

We are seeing that many species, including the ancestors of modern elephants, were much more adaptable to varied climates than previously thought. The data also reveals a 'Genetic Blueprint' for how these ancient organisms survived in a world with CO2 levels similar to those projected for the late 21st century."

While technology is still years away from 'printing' a living mastodon, we now have the genomic data to understand the unique metabolic and physical traits that allowed these animals to thrive. More practically, the Copenhagen project is using this ancient data to help modern conservationists identify 'Resilient Alleles'—traits from the past that could help modern species survive the rapidly changing climate of 2026. The past, it seems, is the ultimate laboratory for the future."
