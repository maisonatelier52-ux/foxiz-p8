Available immediately to residents in Germany, France, and Italy, the Digital Euro aims to combine the security of central bank money with the convenience of instant mobile payments.",

It is pegged 1:1 with the physical euro and is designed to operate without transaction fees, providing a state-backed alternative to private payment platforms like Visa, Mastercard, and Apple Pay."

Users can load up to 200 euros onto their mobile wallets for offline transactions, mimicking the privacy of physical banknotes. However, for larger amounts, the currency uses a 'permissioned distributed ledger,' allowing the bank to track high-value transactions to combat money laundering and terrorism financing."

If the Digital Euro manages to capture a significant portion of daily retail payments, it could weaken the global dominance of US-centered credit networks. Already, several Northern African nations have expressed interest in integrating their payment systems with the ECB's new architecture."

To mitigate this risk, the ECB has capped individual holdings at 3,000 euros. As the system scales to include all 20 member states by 2027, the very nature of money in the 21st century is undergoing a radical, state-led transformation."
