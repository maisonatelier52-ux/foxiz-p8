            "text": "For thirty years, the efficiency of commercial solar panels has hovered around the 20% mark, constrained by the physical properties of silicon. But a 'Rainbow' revolution is underway. This morning, researchers announced that their new 'Perovskite-Tandem' cells have reached a verified 35% efficiency in laboratory conditions, with a path to reach 40% by the end of the decade. This isn't just a marginal improvement; it is a fundamental shift in the economics of light.",

            "text": "The breakthrough lies in 'Spectral Splitting.' While traditional silicon cells only capture the red and infrared parts of the sunlight, the perovskite layer—a synthetic crystal structure—is tuned to capture the high-energy blue and violet light. By layering the two, the cell can harvest the entire visible spectrum, effectively doubling the energy output of the same surface area."

            "text": "Until now, perovskite cells were notorious for their instability, often degrading when exposed to moisture or extreme heat. The 2026 milestone was achieved by using a 'Molecular Shield'—a layer of graphene just one atom thick that protects the sensitive perovskite crystals while allowing electrons to flow freely. Accelerated aging tests suggest these new panels will last 25 years, matching the industry standard for silicon."

            "text": "The manufacturing process for perovskite is significantly simpler and cheaper than the high-heat vacuum processes required for silicon. It can be 'printed' onto flexible substrates using roll-to-roll technology, similar to how newspapers are printed. This means we could soon see 'Solar Paint' for skyscrapers and 'Solar Fabric' for curtains and clothing. As the first gigawatt-scale perovskite factory starts production in Arizona this fall, the cost of solar energy is projected to drop by another 50%, cementing its position as the cheapest energy source in human history."
