This month, 120 nations officially signed the 'Space Resource Management Treaty' in Vienna, ending a decade of legal ambiguity regarding who owns the minerals found on celestial bodies. The treaty establishes the 'Common Heritage/Private Incentive' balance, allowing corporations to claim ownership of extracted materials while mandating that and the actual 'territory' remains the property of no state.",

This ice can be converted into liquid hydrogen and oxygen, creating 'Orbital Gas Stations' that will drastically reduce the cost of missions to Mars and beyond. The new treaty establishes 'Safety Zones' around these critical resource nodes to prevent the type of geopolitical 'land grabs' that have historically plagued terrestrial frontiers."

Any corporation extracting resources from the Moon or asteroids must pay a 10% 'Innovation Levy' on their net proceeds. This fund is then distributed to developing nations to help them build their own space-tracking and satellite infrastructure, ensuring that the 'Space Gold Rush' doesn't just benefit the wealthiest 1% of nations."

Commercial actors are now legally responsible for the entire lifecycle of their equipment, with heavy penalties for any company that leaves 'dead' satellites or launch stages in high-traffic orbits. As the first robotic mining drills begin to touch down on the lunar surface, the Vienna Treaty provides the essential legal scaffolding for a sustainable and equitable space economy."
