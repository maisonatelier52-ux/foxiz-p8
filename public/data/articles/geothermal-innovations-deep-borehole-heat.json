            "text": "For decades, geothermal energy was the 'forgotten' renewable, constrained by geography to the volcanic edges of the world. But the 2026 results from the 'Core-Drive' project in West Texas suggest that the ground beneath our feet is a universal battery waiting to be tapped. By utilizing millimeter-wave energy to vaporize rock rather than mechanical drill bits, the team has reached depths of 7 kilometers, where the temperature remains a constant 300 degrees Celsius regardless of surface conditions.",

            "text": "Traditional geothermal requires 'Hot Rocks' near the surface and a reliable source of water. 'Deep Borehole' technology creates its own closed-loop system. A specialized fluid is pumped down a double-walled pipe; it absorbs the heat of the deep crust and returns to the surface as high-pressure steam, which then drives a conventional turbine. Since the fluid is never in contact with the surrounding environment, there is zero risk of groundwater contamination or induced seismicity."

            "text": "The true value of geothermal is its reliability. While wind and solar require massive battery backup, geothermal provides 'Baseload' power that is 100% predictable. In 2026, the first 'Geothermal Megawatt' from the Texas site was fed into the ERCOT grid, proving that the technology can compete on price with natural gas when the cost of carbon and grid stability is included in the calculation."

            "text": "Because 'Core-Drive' technology can reach the required temperatures in almost any geological setting, it has the potential to turn every coal-fired power plant in the world into a clean geothermal hub. By repurposing the existing turbines, transmission lines, and cooling systems, the cost of the transition is reduced by 60%. As the first international pilots break ground in Germany and India later this year, the 'Forgotten Renewable' is poised to become the cornerstone of the post-fossil-fuel grid."
