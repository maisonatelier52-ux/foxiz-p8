But in 2026, the data shows a massive 'De-concentration.' Capital is flowing at an unprecedented rate into secondary hubs—the so-called 'Tiger Cub' corridors—where a combination of young populations, aggressive green-energy mandates, and 'Neutral Geopolitics' is creating a perfect storm for growth.",

The Da Nang Tech Corridor has seen a 40% increase in FDI this year alone, as global chipmakers diversify their assembly and testing sites away from more contested waters. Following closely is Indonesia, which is leveraging its massive nickel reserves to become the 'Battery Factory of the World,' attracting billions from both Western and Pacific EV manufacturers."

These emerging hubs are using FDI to build out massive solar and offshore wind grids to power their factories, allowing global corporations to maintain their 'Net Zero' commitments while manufacturing at scale. This 'Climate-Compatible Growth' has become the primary metric for investors, who are increasingly avoiding regions with high coal-dependence."

For now, the momentum remains firmly with the South.",
