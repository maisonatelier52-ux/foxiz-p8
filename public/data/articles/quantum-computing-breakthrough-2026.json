This morning, at the Global Quantum Summit in Zurich, IBM unveiled 'Everest'—a 1,121-qubit processor that has successfully demonstrated high-fidelity error correction at room-stable temperatures. This breakthrough effectively marks the end of the 'noisy' era of quantum computing and begins the age of practical application.",

            "text": "For decades, the primary hurdle in quantum computing has not been the number of qubits, but their stability. Quantum states are notoriously fragile, collapsing at the slightest touch of thermal or electromagnetic noise. Previous attempts at error correction required massive overhead—often thousands of physical qubits just to protect a single logical qubit. Everest changes the math entirely."

            "text": "The technical leap lies in a new 'Topological Lattice' cooling system that allows qubits to maintain coherence for minutes rather than milliseconds. By using a proprietary niobium-titanium alloy for the circuitry, IBM has managed to localize quantum operations with an accuracy of 99.998%. This precision allows the hardware to identify and fix errors in mid-calculation without halting the process."
